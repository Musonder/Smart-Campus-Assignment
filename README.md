# 🎓 Argos: Smart Campus Orchestration Platform

This repository implements the **“Argos: A Federated, Adaptive Smart Campus Orchestration Platform”** assignment using Python microservices, a React + TypeScript frontend, ML‑assisted analytics, event sourcing, and a Raft‑based consensus service.

👉 **Start here:** read [`README_FIRST.md`](./README_FIRST.md). It is the **primary guide** and explains:

- How to install Python dependencies (`requirements-quick.txt`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`).
- How to start Docker (Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, etc.) using `docker-compose.yml` and `READY_TO_RUN.md`.
- How to run all services and the frontend with `START_ALL.bat`.
- How to run tests and what's needed for the assignment (stress tests, pen‑tests, CI).

This `README.md` is intentionally short so tools that expect a `README` still work, while all detailed instructions and assignment mapping live in:

- `README_FIRST.md` – **main getting-started & operations guide** (Docker, requirements, demo flows).
- `READY_TO_RUN.md` – **Docker & environment setup**.
- `ASSIGNMENT_COMPLIANCE.md` / `ASSIGNMENT_VERIFICATION.md` – how the code satisfies the assignment rubric and how to demo it.
- `API_ENDPOINTS.md` – full REST API reference with example requests.
- `FRONTEND_FEATURES.md` / `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` – detailed frontend features and implementation notes.
- `SYSTEM_STATUS.md` – current feature matrix and verification checklist.

If you only read one document: **open `README_FIRST.md`**. It links to everything else you need.
